# Paper Survey for Customer Lifetime Value Prediction:
## Traditional Approach: RFM model, pareto(BG)/NBD
- Assumption: transaction rate ~ exponential dist.; inactive probability p; heterogeneity of transaction rate ~ gamma dist.; heterogeneity of p ~ beta dist.
- using MLE to estimate parameters and use the estimated probabilistic model to predict life time value
- pros: Simple
- cons: lack of demographic variables, other useful information.....

## ML approach:
- Most papers focus on how different algorithm dominates others. (Eg: RF > SVM, DL > Traditional ML, The power of CNN....)
- Usage of customer transaction data: client/item embedding by word2vec/mSDA.....
- A model with embedding of transaction/behavioral data might outperform handcrafted ones.
- Data Imbalance: SMOTE 

## System design: An Engagement-Based Customer Lifetime Value System for E-commerce
- Customer segmentation by frequency
- 2 stage model
- Consider seasonal effect
- Efficient Daily Update: Decay effect
- Consider experience and Engagement data.
- RF

# Summarize:

## Problem definition
- First to define: The time period of customer value wanted to predict
- Rolling time window updating every day?
- time window looking back
- Target users: Separate new users without transaction record and those with, how about frequency? who are the ones interested?
- 2 stage model?

## Data:
- Transaction Detail (Dynamic): Spot, future, sub
- Profit and Loss (Dynamic)
- Demographic variables: Age, gender, address(通訊OR戶籍), income(x)(replace by交易限額?), occupation(x), nationality(x)? 庫存
- Engagement data: (X)

## Data exploration:
- Check demographic variables and LTV
- Try different transformation of address data: location, city, house value, channel?
- Aggregated transaction/engagement information: frequency, others?
- total profit and loss
- previous total value and next year total value
- others?

## Feature Engineering:
- Demographic variables
- Usage of transaction/P&L/engagement data: Embedding (Stacked autoencoder? CNN? Data transformation?)
- Embedding Layer in Model Arch
