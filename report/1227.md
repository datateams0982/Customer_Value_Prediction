# Paper Survey for Customer Lifetime Value Prediction:
## Traditional Approach: RFM model, pareto(BG)/NBD
- Assumption: transaction rate ~ exponential dist.; inactive probability p; heterogeneity of transaction rate ~ gamma dist.; heterogeneity of p ~ beta dist.
- using MLE to estimate parameters and use the estimated probabilistic model to predict life time value
- pros: Simple
- cons: lack of demographic variables, other useful information.....

## ML approach:
- Most papers focus on how different algorithm dominates others. (Eg: RF > SVM, DL > Traditional ML, The power of CNN....)
- Usage of customer transaction data: client/item embedding by word2vec/mSDA.....
- A model with embedding of transaction/behavioral data might outperform handcrafted ones.
- Data Imbalance: SMOTE 

## System design: An Engagement-Based Customer Lifetime Value System for E-commerce
- Customer segmentation by frequency
- 2 stage model
- Consider seasonal effect
- Efficient Daily Update: Decay effect
- Consider experience and Engagement data.
- RF
